- **Grab beats Block**: Deals 1.5× damage and extra knockback when grabbing a blocking opponent.
- **Block beats Attack**: Reduces incoming attack damage by 75%.
- **Attack beats Grab**: Grabs are punishable — if you miss, you're vulnerable.

## Tips
- Sprint to close distance, but watch your stamina.
- Dodge roll has invincibility frames — time it to avoid hits.
- Use the arena edge! Charged heavy attacks can ring-out opponents.
- Pick up items for round-long buffs.
- Mix up your offense: if they block, grab them. If they grab, attack them.
